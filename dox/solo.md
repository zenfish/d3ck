Testing your d3ck
-----------------

A fair bit of d3ck functionality requires two d3cks, so it can be hard
to test much if you finally get your own running.

If your computer has a working video cam there is a simple way to test
if video works, at least, and if you want to share your username &
password with someone else, you can both login to the same d3ck and use
its video capabilities.

Upon logging into your d3ck, you'll see something like a blank screen -
at the top on the right-hand side there's a little video icon:

<p align="center">
<img width="400" src="/dox/blank-video.png">
</p>

Clicking on the icon's tab/caret should pull down a menu with two items -

    Test/Host Local Video
    Connnect local D3ck

Selecting the first (Test/Host...) should prompt you to grant permission
to use your camera - in Firefox it pops up a little box that looks
something like this:

<p align="center">
<img src="/dox/ff-perm.png">
</p>

Chrome has a thin strip between the page content and its menu bars, like:

<p align="center">
<img src="/dox/chrome-perm.png">
</p>

If you permit them to, you should see your smilin' face on the right-hand
side of the screen, under the "Local" label.
