Quick-n-Dirty d3ckin', or simply testing your d3ck
--------------------------------------------------

A fair bit of d3ck functionality requires two d3cks, so it can be hard
to test much if you finally get your own running.

If your computer has a working video cam there is a simple way to test
if video works, at least, and if you want to share your username &
password with someone else, you can both login to the same d3ck and use
its video capabilities.

The short version:

    login

    pull down the video menu at the top and select Test/Host Local Video

    grant camera permissions

    login to the d3ck with the same or another browser, on the same or another computer

    Select the Connect local d3ck option

    grant camera permissions

    Confidential video conferencing will fire up


The longer one follows....


Upon logging into your d3ck, you'll see something like a blank screen -
at the top on the right-hand side there's a little video icon:

<p align="center">
<img width="400" src="/dox/blank-video.png">
</p>

Clicking on the icon's tab/caret should pull down a menu with two items -

    Test/Host Local Video
    Connnect local D3ck

Selecting the first (Test/Host...) should prompt you to grant permission
to use your camera - in Firefox it pops up a little box that looks
something like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

Chrome has a thin strip between the page content and its menu bars, like:

</p>

If you permit them to, you should see your smilin' face in glorious color
(well, unless you're hooked up to a 50's era Zenith TV or something)
on the right-hand side of the screen, under the "Local" label.


A second window, browser, or person can login and select the 2nd button -
"Connect local D3ck" - and you should see the final connection, something like -
