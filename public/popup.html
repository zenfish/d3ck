Welcome to your d3ck!

<p>

<div>

The first thing you might want to do is to add a friendly d3ck - you'll
need both an IP address (hostnames and FQDN's, such as "fish2.com", will
be supported ASAP; they may or may not work now) and a friendly owner.

I've set up a d3ck on Amazon's EC2 that should auto-accept if you try
to add it for practice - its IP address is:

</div>

<p>
    <blockquote> 54.203.255.17 </blockquote>
<p>

Error checking, hand-holding, and all that stuff are at a minimum here,
I'm sorry to say ;(  It'll get better!

<p>

If you have any questions, comments, complaints, etc., just drop me a line
at any of my usual addresses or at:

<p>
    <blockquote> 
        <a href="mailto:zen@d3ck.com?Subject=d3ck stuff" target="_top">zen@d3ck.com</a>
    </blockquote>
<p>

I hope you find your d3ck useful.
