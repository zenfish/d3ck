<h3>Welcome to your d3ck!</h3>

<p>

<div style="color:red">

    <h4>Your browser doesn't fully support things... click on the
    button below, which will start up a new page and try to rectify
    the situation.  You should close the new window, assuming it loads
    properly (you may have to accept the certificate again.) If it
    doesn't work... well, it may or may not affect the rest ;)</h4>

</div>

The first thing you might want to do is to add a friendly d3ck - you'll
need both an IP address (hostnames and FQDN's, such as "fish2.com", will
be supported ASAP; they may or may not work now) and a friendly owner.

I've set up a d3ck on Amazon's EC2 that should auto-accept if you try
to add it for practice - its IP address is:

</div>

<p>
    <blockquote> 54.203.255.17 </blockquote>
<p>

Error checking, hand-holding, and all that stuff are at a minimum here,
I'm sorry to say ;(  It'll get better!

<p>

If you have any questions, comments, complaints, etc., just drop me a line
at any of my usual addresses or at:

<p>
    <blockquote> 
        <a href="mailto:zen@d3ck.com?Subject=d3ck stuff" target="_top">zen@d3ck.com</a>
    </blockquote>
<p>

I hope you find your d3ck useful.
